# Programming Language Suggester
#### _A quiz to match coding language and personality, updated Jan 17, 2020_

#### By _**Krista Rutz**_

## Description

This project is an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Though all languages have similarities and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, differences in personality may imply success in one language or another.

This quiz determines which of these languages a user is best-suited to learn:
* Ruby
* C# or Java
* JavaScript
* Python

My Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. It includes a survey with five questions.

## Installation/How to Use
